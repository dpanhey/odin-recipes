# odin-recipes

In this project i will demonstrate some new skills i recently learned at theodinproject.com.

In this project i learned:

Building a website (Repices) from scratch with
- a index.html as a homepage to navigate trough the website
- some more documents with recipes
and all that includes
- headings
- images
- paragraphs
- links
- ordered and unordered links

I also learned to create 
- a new repository on Github
use the command line to see
- the status of modified and not staged documents
- add them to the staging area
- commit them
- log them to see what happened recently
- push them to the GitHub repository
