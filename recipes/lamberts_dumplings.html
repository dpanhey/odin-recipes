    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>What do witchers eat? Probably you asked yourself this question more than once … in turn, we would rather ask if witchers, except skills useful in their profession, also have a culinary talent?</p>
    <p>It might seem that after passing the mutations trial, qualified monster killers are not really familiar with culinary pleasures. Nothing could be more wrong! In books, Geralt often has an occasion to taste local specialties, from both simple and more exquisite cuisine. White wolf, together with his travel companions, enjoyed dishes served in roadside taverns as well as in the most wonderful inns or royal banquets. Well, but do witchers know how to cook something by themselves? In the books of Andrzej Sapkowski the subject of kitchen arts wasn’t pushed into the background by other plots. In addition to the diverse characteristics of the dishes assigned to specific regions and places in the universe, the author even attempted to distinguish some characters by determining their culinary skills. And thanks to that we know what witchers ate in Kaer Morhen and that even one of the them, Lambert, was given a very special distinction… a total lack of culinary talent.</p>

    <h3>Dumplings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>raw potatoes, 500g</li>
        <li>egg - 1 small</li>

        <li>boletus (or bay boletus), dried - 20 g</li>
        <li>bear's garlic, dried - 1 tsp</li>
        <li>butter - 1 tbs</li>
        <li>freshly ground pepper</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place boletus in a pot and pour hot water to the level of mushrooms, soak them for 20 minutes, then strain.</li>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and grate them on the smallest grating mesh. Squeeze the potato mass through the gaze to separate the liquid, pour it into a separate bowl, and set aside for 15 minutes. Pour out the liquid carefully (discard it), then add the sludge (starch) accumulated on the bottom of the bowl to the grated and drained potatoes.</li>
        <li>Add the egg, flour and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the grated potatoes. Mix. Put the dough on a large, flat plate, level it with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Boil a few liters of water in a large pot, add 1 tablespoon of salt. Put dumplings into boiling water - by pulling the small portion of a dough with a spoon from the plate directly into the water.  Cook the dumplings for about 3-4 minutes. If they disintegrate in water, add more flour to the mass. After cooking, remove dumplings with a slotted spoon and place in a bowl.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, slice the onion. Melt the butter in a frying pan and fry the onion slices for 1 minute. Then add drained mushrooms and fry for 10 minutes on low heat, until slightly browned. Season with salt, fresh pepper and bear’s garlic. Finally, add the cooked dumplings and fry over high heat for one minute, stirring frequently. Serve hot.</li>
