    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The famous Mahakam potato soup (“zalewajka mahakamska” in Polish) from the book Season of Storms by Andrzej Sapkowski is probably the most recognizable culinary symbol of the Witcher universe. It's all due to the way in which this dish appeared on the pages of the story about a white-haired monster killer.</p>
    <p>The author not only introduces the topic of the dish into a dialogue line but also distinguishes the mahakam specialty by posting a complete recipe as a fragment from the cookbook by Eleonora Rhundurin-Pigott entitled: „Perfect Mahakam Cuisine, the Precise Science of Cooking and Making Dishes from Meats, Fishes and Vegetables, also Seasoning Diverse Sauces, Baking Cakes, Making Jam, Preparing Cooked Meats, Preserves, Wines, Spirits, and Various Useful Cooking and Preserving Secrets, Essential for Every Good and Thrifty Housewife”.</p>

        <li>bay leaf - 2 leaves</li>
        <li>rye sourdough bread - crust from 1 slice (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>You also need</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>clean jar</li>
        <li>clean wooden scoop</li>
        <li>big pot</li>
        <li>pan</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Sourdough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Day 1: Put flour into the jar, pour in the lukewarm water and mix well. Add spices (don't peel the garlic) and crust of 1 slice of sourdough rye bread (it will speed up the fermentation, it's optional). Cover with a cloth or gauze. Set aside in a warm and dark place for about 24h. After this time, just mix the sourdough with wooden scoop. Set aside for another day.</li>
        <li>Day 2-6: Mix the sourdough once each day with a perfectly clean wooden scoop. The sourdough should start to smell soury after 5-6 days and be ready to use (it's better and stronger after one week).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Soup</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the chanterelles under running water, put them in a pot, cover with fresh water, add salt (1 teaspoon) and half of the onion; then bring to a boil, turn of the heat and leave covered for 15-20 min. Next, discard the onion, drain the mushrooms (but save the broth for later, and be sure to discard some sand residue!) and chop mushrooms into small chunks.</li>
        <li>Peel and cube the potatoes, put into a pot, cover with slighlty saletd water, bring to a boil and cook until almost soft.</li>
        <li>Cut bacon into small cubes, add in a pan along with a 2 tbsp of cold water, turn on the heat and cook for a few minutes, until bacon is lighlty browned. Add sliced onions, fry until lightly browned and sticky, stirring frequently. Then add the mushrooms and fry for 2 min. Add crushed garlic, mix and fry for 1 min.</li>
        <li>Transfer fried ingredients into a pot, pour in the mushroom broth, add potatoes along with their cooking water and sourdough. Bring to a boil, then cook on a low heat until potatoes are completely soft. Season with salt, pepper and marjoram. Add more water if the soup it too thick. You can also add more sourdough if soup is not sour enough.</li>
        <li>At the end, if you are human, add some cream. It's against dwarven tradition, but humans like to do so.<br>First, take 2-3 spoons of hot soup into the mug, add cream, mix and then pour into the pot with the rest of the soup - it prevents curdling the cream.</li>
    </ol>
