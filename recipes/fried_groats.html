    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Local inns and taverns are the proper haven both for weary travelers as well as local townsfolk who seek fair meals and drinks. Barrels and mugs of beer, chunks of cheese, thick slices of bread… that would probably be enough to satisfy the common inn guests, but sometimes the local cooks feel the urge to conjure something more ambitious, even from the basic ingredients...</p>
    <p>This recipe was designed on the basis of both episode 1 of the TV series, as well as books. We cannot see exactly what Renfri eats while speaking with Geralt in Blaviken's inn, but in Polish version of the books (in conversation between Geralt and Blaviken's voyt) we read that groats are served with "omasta", which means liquid fat/gravy in Polish. In English translation of Sapkowski's books, bacon is mentioned instead. That's why we decided to connect these references and prepare a very nutritious breakfast meal! Fried groats with crunchy bacon, aromatic mushrooms and fresh eggs is a meal based on everyday ingredients which are common for tavern keepers supplies. However, this meal is not only very nutritious but extremely tasty - and it's widely known that it can significantly raise the morale of every weary traveler!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>spelt groats - ¾ cup</li>
        <li>smoked bacon - ⅔ cup</li>
        <li>onion - ½ a large onion</li>
        <li>bay boletus, dried -1 cup (20g)</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>bear’s garlic - 1 tsp</li>
        <li>parsley - a bunch</li>
        <li>freshly ground pepper & salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak mushrooms in ½ cup of lukewarm water (for about 30 min), drain and roughly chop</li>
        <li>Rinse groats under cold water. Put groats in pot with boiling, slightly salted water (1:2 ratio). Cook over low flame until water evaporates and groats are al dente (12-15 min).</li>
        <li>Cut bacon into small cubes and put in a pan with a splash of cold water. Fry on a medium heat until bacon is golden-brown, stirring from time to time. Transfer bacon to the bowl, but keep melted fat on the pan.</li>
        <li>Add sliced onion with drained mushrooms and a pinch of salt to the pan and fry for few min until soft and golden, stirring from time to time.</li>
        <li>Add cooked groats, fried bacon and chopped parsley on the pan. Season with pepper, salt and bear’s garlic. Mix and fry for 2-3 min on high heat, then put in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add some butter on the pan and fry an egg (yolk should be still a little runny). Season with pepper and salt.</li>
        <li>Transfer fried egg in the bowl with groats and serve with a mug of beer!</li>
    </ol>
